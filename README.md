# Smart-Blind-Stick-Using-Arduino

The blind persons can walk without any fear. This device will one of the best solution to overcome their difficulties.
The main component used for this device is the ultrasonic sensor and arduino. The ultrasonic sensor transmits a high frequency sound pulse and then calculate the time to receive the signal of sound echo to reflect.
As a warning signal a buzzer is connected in the circuit whose frequency of beep changes according to the distance of object. The close distance of obstruction, the more the buzzer beep frequency. We can say that the frequency is inversely proportional to the distance.
