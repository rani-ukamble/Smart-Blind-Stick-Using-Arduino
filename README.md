Smart Blind Stick Using Arduino

The Smart Blind Stick is an innovative device designed to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their surroundings safely and independently. This stick utilizes an ultrasonic sensor as its core component, which continuously emits high-frequency sound pulses. When these pulses encounter an obstacle, they reflect back to the sensor, allowing the system to calculate the distance to the object based on the time it takes for the echo to return.

To alert the user of nearby obstacles, the device is equipped with a buzzer. The frequency of the buzzer's beep changes in response to the distance of the detected objectâ€”the closer the obstacle, the faster the beep frequency. This inverse relationship between distance and beep frequency provides an intuitive and real-time warning system, enabling the user to adjust their movements accordingly. The integration of Arduino into this design allows for precise control and customization of the system's responses, making the Smart Blind Stick a reliable and practical tool for enhancing the mobility and confidence of visually impaired individuals.
